   This assignment is worth 10 points.

 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Test the program
  </strong>
  by running it and issuing three newanimal commands followed by three query commands. Each new animal should involve a different animal type (cow, bird, snake), each with a different name. Each query should involve a different animal and a different property of the animal (eat, move, speak).
  <strong>
   Give 2 points
  </strong>
  for each query for which the program provides the correct response.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Examine the code.
  </strong>
  If the code contains an interface type called
  <strong>
   Animal
  </strong>
  , which is a struct containing three fields, all of which are strings, then
  <strong>
   give another 2 points
  </strong>
  . If the program contains three types – Cow, Bird, and Snake – which all satisfy the Animal interface,
  <strong>
   give another 2 points
  </strong>
  .
