00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,155
Welcome to the second module.

2
00:00:10,155 --> 00:00:13,260
We're going to start talking a little bit more detail about the Go language,

3
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,025
we'll talk about datatypes in Go,

4
00:00:15,025 --> 00:00:16,325
the basic data types.

5
00:00:16,325 --> 00:00:18,635
That's what this module is really about.

6
00:00:18,635 --> 00:00:22,405
We'll go over data types you've seen in other languages, integers,

7
00:00:22,405 --> 00:00:26,140
floats, booleans, strings, variations, all those.

8
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,030
So, you can change the length of the integer,

9
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:30,205
length of the flow, things like this.

10
00:00:30,205 --> 00:00:32,120
So we'll talk about those data types,

11
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,680
we'll talk specifically about how to declare them,

12
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,900
how to create them and what functions are available for them.

13
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,345
So what functions can you apply to integers?

14
00:00:41,345 --> 00:00:44,260
What functions can you apply to strings and booleans and flows?

15
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,000
Once you're done with this,

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,440
you'll be able to use basic data types inside your Go code.
