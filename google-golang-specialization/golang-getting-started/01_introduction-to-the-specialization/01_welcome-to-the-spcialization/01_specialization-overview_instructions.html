  <strong>
   Welcome to the
   <em>
    Programming with Google Go Specialization!
   </em>
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  This intermediate-level, three-course sequence is designed for individuals who have had some experience programming in another language but now wish to learn about the features and capabilities of Go. The courses provide a review of essential programming concepts, as needed, to ensure that all learners are sufficiently comfortable with the basics before learning about the features that are peculiar to Go.  (Please note that the original specialization design called for four courses but development of the fourth course has been deferred to a later time. For now, please disregard the occasional references that the instructor makes to this fourth course.)
 </p>
 <p>
  The first course,
  <em>
   Getting Started with Go
  </em>
  , introduces the basic elements of the language including unique features such as slices that are not available in other programming environments. The second course,
  <em>
   Functions, Methods, and Interfaces in Go,
  </em>
  expands your knowledge of Go with a focus on object-oriented features such as classes and encapsulation, and allows you to practice writing code to solve practical problems. The third and final course,
  <em>
   Concurrency in Go
  </em>
  , shows you how to write Go code that executes more rapidly through parallel execution in multi-processor environments.
 </p>
 <p>
  The courses feature video lectures by Professor Ian Harris from the University of California, Irvine and are accompanied by automatically graded multiple-choice quizzes and peer-reviewed programming assignments. While most of the information needed to complete the programming assignments is presented within the context of the courses (i.e. by the lecturer), we encourage students to take advantage of the many resources that are available online for clarification and further learning.
