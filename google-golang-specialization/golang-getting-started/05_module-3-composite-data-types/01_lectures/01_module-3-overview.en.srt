Welcome to Module 3.

2
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:12,250
Now, we're talking about composite datatypes.

3
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:16,770
So composite data types are data types that aggregate other data types together,

4
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,545
so they bring together lots of different data types.

5
00:00:19,545 --> 00:00:22,515
Specifically, we're going to be talking about arrays,

6
00:00:22,515 --> 00:00:26,795
slices, maps and structs.

7
00:00:26,795 --> 00:00:30,360
Composite data types are essential for complicated code,

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,770
for real code, because simple data types,

9
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:35,780
basic data types aren't enough to describe the conflict,

10
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:39,150
concepts that you're going to need to refer to in big pieces of code.

11
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:40,705
So you need to aggregate them.

12
00:00:40,705 --> 00:00:42,605
Maybe you have strings here, integers there,

13
00:00:42,605 --> 00:00:45,140
you merge them all into one thing that describes

14
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:48,605
whatever the concepts are that you're referring to in your particular application.

15
00:00:48,605 --> 00:00:51,500
What you've done with this, you'll be able to use

16
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,560
more complicated composite datatypes inside your Go code.
