00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:10,660
Welcome to the course, Course One.

2
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:12,870
The point of this course is to give you

3
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:18,545
some first-tier working knowledge of the Go language and how to use it.

4
00:00:18,545 --> 00:00:22,910
I'm assuming that you already have some experience programming in other languages,

5
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:25,470
so I'm not talking from scratch here.

6
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,390
I'm assuming you already have seen a lot of these concepts.

7
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:30,675
You know data types, you know things like this,

8
00:00:30,675 --> 00:00:34,080
but maybe you're familiar with C or Python or

9
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,440
Java or something like that and you want to move over to Go.

10
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,655
Maybe you want to start programming systems devices right.

11
00:00:41,655 --> 00:00:43,790
You want to do some more low-level stuff

12
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:45,915
but you don't want to go straight to C, let's say,

13
00:00:45,915 --> 00:00:48,110
or you've been dealing in C in a long time and you want

14
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:50,550
your life to be easier right? Something like that.

15
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,955
In fact, Go on the whole is a sort of sweet spot,

16
00:00:53,955 --> 00:00:56,835
where it's efficient, close to C,

17
00:00:56,835 --> 00:01:01,010
but it's also easy to use like say maybe Python or Java, has a lot of that.

18
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:06,585
So it's in-between, and so we're going to just hit on all the basics in this class,

19
00:01:06,585 --> 00:01:07,720
in this particular course,

20
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,830
and you should be able to program something and get

21
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:12,030
a feel for it and see if you even like this language at all,

22
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,400
and if you can be comfortable with it.
