1
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:15,390
We'll talk right now about how you download and install the Go tools,

2
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,210
just to get you started running a program.

3
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,400
Right now, we'll talk about

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,865
the download process and then next I'll go through actually doing it,

5
00:00:24,865 --> 00:00:27,475
showing you how to compile your first program,

6
00:00:27,475 --> 00:00:29,335
but right here, just talk about installing,

7
00:00:29,335 --> 00:00:31,040
which is fairly straightforward.

8
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:35,615
So, first thing you are going to do is go to golang.org,

9
00:00:35,615 --> 00:00:39,010
and this is a snippet of the page when you go there.

10
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:40,530
This isn't the whole page,

11
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:41,680
I had to fit it on the slide,

12
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,590
but this is what it basically looks like,

13
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:44,750
at least right now it does,

14
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,320
that can change over time of course.

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,220
You can see the gopher, see that little gopher.

16
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:51,920
You'll see that gopher icon over and over again.

17
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:58,120
Gopher is the mascot of the Go programming language like Unix, you got demons.

18
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,240
So, Go you have the gopher,

19
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,485
but the main thing to look at here is that button down there that says Download Go.

20
00:01:04,485 --> 00:01:05,810
So, that's first thing you're going to click on.

21
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:07,630
You're going to see Download Go, you click on that.

22
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:09,940
Actually also look at this,

23
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:12,500
on the left side, when you go to the web page, you'll see the whole screen.

24
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,970
I've cut it off here, but on the left side,

25
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:18,800
you could see there's a yellow box there

26
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,410
where you can type in Go code and click on the Run button,

27
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:22,690
it'll compile and run it.

28
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:25,745
So, it'll compile it remotely and run it remotely.

29
00:01:25,745 --> 00:01:27,385
We're not going to use that,

30
00:01:27,385 --> 00:01:29,180
instead we're going to download the compiler,

31
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:30,530
we're going to download Go Download to

32
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,950
your machine locally and you'll be doing it locally,

33
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:35,010
but if you want to just fool around,

34
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:37,080
you could type in their, type some go program in there,

35
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,035
click run, and it would actually execute it.

36
00:01:39,035 --> 00:01:43,370
So, what we're doing now is we're going to click Download Go to download the tools.

37
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,925
Now, when you do that, you come to a page that looks like this.

38
00:01:46,925 --> 00:01:49,965
Now, again I'm only showing a part of the page,

39
00:01:49,965 --> 00:01:52,445
there's more below it and to the right.

40
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,930
Basically, when you download Go,

41
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:58,590
you can download the precompiled versions for different platforms.

42
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,495
They've got Windows, and Linux,

43
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:05,050
and Mac OS and you can also download the source if you want to,

44
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:07,530
and you could compile all of the Go from scratch,

45
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,295
it's whole tools chain from scratch if you wanted to.

46
00:02:10,295 --> 00:02:13,105
We will not be doing that. That is pain.

47
00:02:13,105 --> 00:02:15,290
We won't be doing that, but know that you could,

48
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:18,780
it is open source and all the sources are right there for download if you want it.

49
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,800
So, I'm going to be doing this on a Windows machine,

50
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,335
although you could be doing it on a Linux or a Mac OS machine, either way.

51
00:02:24,335 --> 00:02:26,910
So, go for the feature downloads,

52
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,335
they make it pretty easy.

53
00:02:28,335 --> 00:02:31,900
For Windows, you pick that MSI file that they've got highlighted right there.

54
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:36,090
Basically, what you want is the newest stable precompiled version.

55
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:39,440
I don't see unstable ones on here,

56
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,510
but I would recommend the stable, but it's up to you.

57
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,020
Anyway, you go for a new version,

58
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,965
click the featured one and you download the MSI.

59
00:02:46,965 --> 00:02:48,490
Now, once you get that,

60
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:51,560
remember if you have an antivirus on your machine,

61
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,875
it can pop up and worry about this and complain,

62
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:57,010
but just say okay.

63
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,410
Then once you start running it, it'll start a wizard.

64
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:02,210
Now, you've seen these installation wizards and

65
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:04,235
this is sort of a standard installation wizard.

66
00:03:04,235 --> 00:03:06,690
Just obey the wizard and click Next, Next,

67
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:09,240
and it will ask you where you want to install the tool,

68
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,175
what directory you want it in, and so on.

69
00:03:11,175 --> 00:03:13,190
The default locations were fine with me,

70
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,400
but that of course is up to you.
