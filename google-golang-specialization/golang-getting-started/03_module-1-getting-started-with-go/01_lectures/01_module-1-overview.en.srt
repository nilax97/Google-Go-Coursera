1
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:14,355
Point of this first module is to talk about more fully four things.

2
00:00:14,355 --> 00:00:16,155
First thing, is we want to talk about Go,

3
00:00:16,155 --> 00:00:18,535
why it's good, why is unique.

4
00:00:18,535 --> 00:00:19,890
Right? We want to motivate you,

5
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,230
to just tell you why do you need even learn this in

6
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,830
the first place as compared to existing languages because there are many, right?

7
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,400
So, we'll talk about that.

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,965
Then, we'll have you start using Go.

9
00:00:29,965 --> 00:00:32,270
So, this specifically means installing

10
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:36,820
the Go environment and compiling your first program,

11
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,400
you need to get through that before you can go on with the rest of the course.

12
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,475
So, we'll walk you through the installation process and show you how to

13
00:00:43,475 --> 00:00:48,730
compile a program and see if it works as a sanity check for the whole setup.

14
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:51,260
Then, will start talking about the code organization,

15
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,670
the recommended court organization.

16
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:56,655
So, workspace, how you define your workspace,

17
00:00:56,655 --> 00:00:58,400
how it should be organized,

18
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,290
how Go code is organized into packages to allow you to share.

19
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:05,325
So, big point of Go is sharing with other people.

20
00:01:05,325 --> 00:01:09,300
Right? Because if you think about any real software you write, it's always big.

21
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,810
Right? You work with other people's.

22
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,500
Almost never just you alone.

23
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,040
So, you got to share and packages help to make that

24
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,790
easy and to organize the code so you can trade your code with other people.

25
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:21,970
Then, at the end of this module,

26
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:23,839
we'll start talking about variables.

27
00:01:23,839 --> 00:01:25,480
Start talk about the language itself,

28
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,850
so the variables, what types there are,

29
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:29,080
and how do you do scoping,

30
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,660
how variable scoping happens,

31
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:33,320
how you basically resolve the value of

32
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,380
a variable depending on where it occurs and where it's defined.
